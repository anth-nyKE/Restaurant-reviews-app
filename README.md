# Udacity Front End Web Developer NanoDegree

## Final Project

## What is expected

Provided beforehand is code for a restaurant reviews website. `https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1`
The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser,much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

The main goal for this project is to create a responsive and accessible website that renders well regardless of the device being used to access it.


## What I have done
Since Udacity provides the starter code, all of the technical aspects of the site have been implemented.
The only bit left was to make the site accessible using skills gained through the course including

    * Responsive Images
    * Web accessibility.
    * Responsive desing.

I have incorporated the above design parameters to make the website scale accordingly and become user-accessible.

### Running the Code

**Pre-requisite:** Python needs to be downloaded and installed on your computer.

    * Download the project and navigate to the directory containing the folder.
    * Launch a `terminal` or `Windows Command Prompt/ windows powershell` in that directory and use the commands
     `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
    * The last bit with the four-digit number represent the port on which the server should run. It doesn't necessarily need   to be port 8000.
    * Once this is done, fire up your browser of choice and key in the address `http:\\localhost:8000`
      If you've used a different port number, ensure you replace the `8000` with your chosen port number.
